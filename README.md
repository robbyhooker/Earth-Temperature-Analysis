## Introduction
Climate change is a critical global issue, and this project aims to analyze climate-related data to better understand trends and patterns over time. Through visualizations and time series regression analysis, I hope to learn, and hopefully teach others, about the data behind of climate change. 

## Features
- Visualizations: Explore various charts and graphs depicting climate-related trends.
- Time Series Regression: Analyze the data using time series regression to identify patterns and make predictions.

## Data Sources
The project utilizes data from [www.berkeleyearth.org](https://berkeleyearth.org/data/) and [https://datahub.io/core/geo-countries](https://datahub.io/core/geo-countries). Please refer to these websites for specific information about the data. 

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Folium 
- Statsmodels
- pmdarima
